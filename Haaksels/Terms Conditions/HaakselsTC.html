    between Laura's Haaksels and the consumer. Before the distance contract is concluded, the text of these terms &
    conditions will be made available to the consumer. If this is not reasonably possible, Laura's Haaksels will specify
    how the terms & conditions can be seen, and that they will be sent free of charge as soon as possible, at the
    consumer's request.</p>

    payment obligations, as well as other facts and factors essential for responsibly entering into a distance contract.
