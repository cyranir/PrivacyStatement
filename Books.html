<p><h1>Privacy Statement - Books app</h1></p>

<p>We understand the importance of privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information of our users. This app stores user data in a secure Google Cloud environment called Firebase. We use this data to provide personalized features and improve the overall functionality of the app.<p>

<p><b>Data Collection and Usage</b><br>
We collect and store information such as your email address and name when you create an account, as well as information related to the books you add to the app. We do not share this information with any third parties. We may use your data to provide personalized recommendations and improve the app's features, however this is currently not on the roadmap.<br>
  
To retrieve book cover images, we use the Google Search API by sending the book title to the service. We do not send any personally identifiable information to the Google Search API.</p>

<p><b>Security</b><br>
We take the security of your information seriously and implement industry-standard measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

<p><b>Third-Party Services</b><br>
Our app uses Firebase, a Google Cloud service, for data storage and user authentication. Firebase maintains its own privacy policy and security measures, which you can review on their website. We also use the Google Search API for retrieving book cover images. You can review Google's privacy policy on their website.</p>

<p><b>Changes to This Privacy Policy</b><br>
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version of the Privacy Policy can be found on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
